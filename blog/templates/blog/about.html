        <h1>My Projects</h1>

            <li>My Personal Website</li>
            <p>
                The website you are now on is fully programmed and powered by myself.
                The reason that I created this website is because, it was a required coursework
                for me that is given by the university I am studying in order to pass into my
                second year. While developing this website, I mainly used Python with the Django
                framework + HTML + CSS. And after I programmed the website, I used Pythonanywhere
                to host my webpage. If you want to learn more, you can head to
                the projects Github page.

            <li>Predict The Number</li>
            <p>
                Predict The Number was my first official game that I developed by using
                Java programming language and Android Studio IDE. The aim of the game was to predict the
                number that the game itself chosed randomly. When you predicted a number, the game will tell
                if the number you predicted is bigger or lower than the actual number, so by doing that you
                were trying to find the actual number.

            <li>Space Invaders</li>
            <p>
                Space Invaders was a small remake project that I did while practising my programming skills
                when I was newly learning about Processing and programming itself. So it is kind of a starting
                project for me to programming.
