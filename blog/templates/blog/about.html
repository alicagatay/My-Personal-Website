                Hi, my name is Ali Cagatay. I am a developer, a blog writer and an algorave developer 
                who is currently studying Computer Science at the University Of Birmingham.

            <h1>My Skills</h1>
            <h2>Programming Languages That I Know</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Processing</li>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>IDEs I Use/Used For Programming</h2>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Eclipse</li>
                <p>
                I am using Eclipse in order to develop Java applications.
                </p>


                <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
                <p>
                Visual Studio Code is nowadays my go to text editor as it is very light and it can do a lot of things.
                I am mainly using Visual Studio Code in order to develop Python apps and web apps using Django framework, HTML and CSS programming languages.
                </p>


                <li>Vim</li>
                <p>
                The thing I love about Vim is that it comes pre-installed on most of the Unix
                based systems. It is very minimalistic both in terms of design and usage. However
                Vim also proves the sentence "Do more with less." While it is a very minimalistic
                text editor, with the help of it's plugins, it can become a powerful and feature packed
                IDE. Nowadays, I am just using Vim when I am connected to different computers over SSH.
                </p>


                <li>IDLE</li>
                <p>IDLE is the main text editor developed for Python itself. While it is so powerful
                    for Python language, I personally doesn't like it a lot because of it's colorscheme.
                </p>


                <li>Sublime Text 2 and 3</li>
                <p>Sublime Text 2 and 3 is the text editor I preferred once for using Python development
                    instead of IDLE, because while it is as powerful as IDLE, it also have a
                    great color scheme. But nowadays I am just sticking to Visual Studio Code.
                </p>


                <li>Android Studio</li>
                <p>
                I use Android Studio in order to develop Android applications with Java.
                </p>


                <li>Sonic Pi</li>
                <p>
                I am using Sonic Pi fairly every day in my free time in order to create live music with code(algorave in other words).
                </p>


            </ol>


            <h2>Frameworks I Use/Used</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Django</li>
                <p>
                I use Django web framework to develop web pages.
                </p>
            </ol>


            <h2>Softwares I Use/Used<h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Github</li>
                <p>Github is a software where you can upload and showcase your code to public. It is mostly useful for
                     Open Source projects and programmming portfolio showcase.</p>


                <li>Git</li>
                <p>Git is a version control system used by teams of 2 and more in order to work on one piece of code more
                    efficiently. It creates a connection between your local computer and the project hosted on Github.

            <h1>My Projects</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>My Personal Website</li>
                <p>
                    The website you are now on is fully programmed and powered by myself.
                    The reason that I created this website is because, it was a required coursework
                    for me that is given by the university I am studying in order to pass into my
                    second year. While developing this website, I mainly used Python with the Django
                    framework + HTML + CSS. And after I programmed the website, I used Pythonanywhere
                    to host my webpage. If you want to learn more, you can head to 
                    the projects Github page.

                <li>Predict The Number</li>
                <p>
                    Predict The Number was my first official game that I developed by using
                    Java programming language and Android Studio IDE. The aim of the game was to predict the
                    number that the game itself chosed randomly. When you predicted a number, the game will tell
                    if the number you predicted is bigger or lower than the actual number, so by doing that you
                    were trying to find the actual number.

                <li>Space Invaders</li>
                <p>
                    Space Invaders was a small remake project that I did while practising my programming skills
                    when I was newly learning about Processing and programming itself. So it is kind of a starting
                    project for me to programming.

                <p>
                    This project is a simple CLI based study timer I developed in Python.
