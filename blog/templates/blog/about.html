                Hi, my name is Ali Cagatay. I am a developer and a blogger 
                who is currently studying Computer Science at the University Of Birmingham.

            <h1>My Skills</h1>
            <h2>Programming Languages That I Know</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Processing</li>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
		<li>C</li>
		<li>Javascript</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>IDEs I Use/Used For Programming</h2>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Eclipse</li>
                <p>
                I am using Eclipse in order to develop Java applications.
                </p>


                <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
                <p>
                Visual Studio Code is a very light and it can do a lot of things.
                I am mainly using Visual Studio Code in order to develop Python apps and web apps using Django 
                framework, HTML and CSS programming languages.
                </p>


                <li>Vim</li>
                <p>
		Vim is my main text editor when I am coding nowadays in most of my projects and studies.
		The thing I love about vim is that it comes pre-installed on most of the Unix based operating
		systems and because of it's minimalistic design, it is very light weight. However, Vim also
		proves the sentence "Do more with less." While it is a very minimalistic text editor, with
		the help of it's plugins and key bindings, it can become a powerfull and feature packed text
		editor.
                </p>


                <li>IDLE</li>
                <p>IDLE is the main text editor developed for Python itself. While it is so powerful
                    for Python language, I personally doesn't like it a lot because of it's colorscheme.
                </p>


                <li>Sublime Text 2 and 3</li>
                <p>Sublime Text 2 and 3 is the text editor I preferred once for using Python development
                    instead of IDLE, because while it is as powerful as IDLE, it also have a
                    great color scheme. But nowadays I am just sticking to Vim.
                </p>


                <li>Android Studio</li>
                <p>
                I use Android Studio in order to develop Android applications with Java.
                </p>


                <li>Sonic Pi</li>
                <p>
		Sonic Pi is a live music coding environment where it allows people to develop algorithmic music,
		in other words algorave, by programming. 
                </p>


            </ol>


            <h2>Frameworks I Use/Used</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Django</li>
                <p>
                I use Django web framework to develop web pages.
                </p>
            </ol>


            <h2>Softwares I Use/Used<h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Github</li>
                <p>Github is a software where you can upload and showcase your code to public. It is mostly useful for
                     Open Source projects and programmming portfolio showcase.</p>


                <li>Git</li>
                <p>Git is a version control system used by teams of 2 and more in order to work on one piece of code more
                    efficiently. It creates a connection between your local computer and the project hosted on Github.
                </p>


		<li>virtualBox</li>
		<p>
		I use virtualBox when I am working on projects where I need a particular operating system such as Linux.

            <h1>My Projects</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>My Personal Website</li>
                <p>
                    The website you are now on is fully programmed and powered by myself.
                    The reason that I created this website is because, it was a required coursework
                    for me that is given by the university I am studying in order to pass into my
                    second year. While developing this website, I mainly used Python with the Django
                    framework + HTML + CSS. And after I programmed the website, I used Pythonanywhere
                    to host my webpage. If you want to learn more, you can head to 
                    the projects Github page.

                <li>Predict The Number</li>
                <p>
                    Predict The Number was my first official game that I developed by using
                    Java programming language and Android Studio IDE. The aim of the game was to predict the
                    number that the game itself chosed randomly. When you predicted a number, the game will tell
                    if the number you predicted is bigger or lower than the actual number, so by doing that you
                    were trying to find the actual number.

                <li>Space Invaders</li>
                <p>
                    Space Invaders was a small remake project that I did while practising my programming skills
                    when I was newly learning about Processing and programming itself. So it is kind of a starting
                    project for me to programming.

                <p>
                    This project is a simple CLI based study timer I developed in Python.
